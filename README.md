Student Mental Health Survey Analysis Project

Overview
This project analyzes a dataset that contains information on various factors affecting students' academic experiences. The data was pre-cleaned and 
complete, allowing for a focus on visualization and correlation analysis.

Objectives
Visualize the distribution of gender among the participants.
Identify and analyze the top three highest correlations between different factors in the dataset.


Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

gender
age
university
degree_level
degree_major
academic_year
cgpa
residential_status
campus_discrimination
sports_engagement
average_sleep
study_satisfaction
academic_workload
academic_pressure
financial_concerns
social_relationships

stress_relief_activities
Visualization

Gender Distribution
A pie chart was created to visualize the gender distribution within the dataset. The analysis revealed a significant majority of male participants, 
indicating potential areas for further exploration regarding gender dynamics as well as female underrepresentation in academic environments.


Correlation Analysis
The analysis identified the top three highest correlations in the dataset:

anxiety and depression: Correlation coefficient: 0.84
depression and isolation: Correlation coefficient: 0.71
isolation and anxiety: Correlation coefficient: 0.67


Conclusion
This project highlights the gender distribution and significant correlations within the dataset, providing insights into the academic experiences of students.
Future work could explore deeper causal relationships and additional demographic factors.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
